# B201-Assignment-1-

1. The purpose of this project is to create a password generator capable of additionally functionality (with a day, date, and time and ability to be appennded to a file)

2. This program is allowed to take in a list of english letters (both upper and lowercase) and special characters. 

3. The expected output for this assignment is a file containing the passwords and the day, date, and time of when it was created.

4. The libraries used were random for the random assortmnent of each letter, os for the operating system for the file to immediately connect with the users file system, and time to detail when the password was created.

4. This program utilized conditional execution and repeated execution which are if/else statements that determine if the user wishes to remove special characters and a for loop that detemrines the amount of passwords to generate.

5. Some potential improvements would be to let the user interact more freely with some of the options and to limit the list's size by using an alternative method as it is inefficient to write it all out.
